    <h1>Storia</h1>
   <p> Welcome to part two of this brief journey through the rich history of one of the newest and most popular art forms, the animated GIF. To read the first part, “The Early Years: 1997–2008,” click here.

GROUP BLOGS, SURF CLUBS, AND THE BEGINNING OF SOCIAL NETWORKING
The period from 2006 to 2010 was marked by the rise of self-started social networks. Artists were sharing GIFs on Myspace before many migrated to their own collaboratively run blogs. These sites hosted an enormous number of found and self-made GIFs, and tended to be male-dominated. A few highlights from the golden era of GIF art blogs below. Digital Media Tree, 2000–present
This consortium of four blogs built on custom software by Jim Bassett includes Bill Schwartz, Sally McKay and Lorna Mills, Tom Moody, and Pst. Only two of the artists focused on New Media and GIFs, the duo of McKay and Mills, and Moody—and he has since moved his blog to WordPress. All that said, Digital Media Tree was a much needed New Media presence in the early blogging scene with archives dating back to 2003, when the blog was mostly image-less.

According to Mills, it was McKay’s interest in animated GIFs that originally influenced her and Moody, both of whom went on to work extensively with the format. McKay’s own GIF production has slowed, but there are vast archives to click through on her page, Mills’, and Moody’s, as well as a paper that McKay wrote in 2009, which closely examines the animated GIF called, “The Affect of Animated GIFs (Tom Moody, Petra Cortright, Lorna Mills).” The essay is required reading for anyone interested in the medium.

Computers Club, 2007–present
Computers Club founder Krist Wood describes it as a “digital sculpture,” a composite artwork shaped by the identities of its contributors. All members have been invited by Wood, and new members are rarely added. Basically, it’s a collaborative art blog with a green rotating splash page and no visible publishing dates. According to the members page, Computers Club has 19 members.

 Unsurprisingly, the blog has hosted seemingly countless GIFs over the seven years it’s been running. Recent images tend to be supersized, but they already tended to be large back when the site launched. Artists usually post their own work.
 
 The Computers Club Drawing Society works differently. Artists are encouraged to apply for membership and invitations are periodically given out. There is a communal set of digital drawing tools members can use to make images, and they are shared on a public page. Most posts draw one or two comments from artists, typically expressing appreciation for the work.
 
 Computers Club Members: Sage Keeler, Petra Cortright, Alexandria McCrosky, Daniel Williams, Matthew Wrath, Laura Brothers, Robert Lorayn, Krist Wood, Rene Abythe, Nicolas Sassoon, Sara Ludy, Duncan Malashock, Travess Smalley, Rafael Rozendaal, Alexander Peverett, Kathleen Daniel, Sabrina Ratte, Elna Frederick, Angelo Plessas, and Wyne Veen.
