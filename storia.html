<h1>History</h1>
<h3>Historical Development of GIFs:</h3>
<p>GIFs have a history that intertwines with the evolution of computer technologies and the emergence of the internet. They were born in 1987 when CompuServe, one of the first online connection services, introduced the GIF format as a way to display color images on computer screens.
</p>
<p>Initially, GIFs were primarily used for static images, but the most distinctive feature of this format was its ability to also support animations. This functionality opened up new creative possibilities, and in 1989, the 87a version of the GIF format introduced support for animated images. This innovation made GIFs ideal for creating short sequences of moving images, paving the way for new forms of artistic expression and entertainment.
</p>
<p>During the 90s, the success of GIFs as an animation format grew. With internet connections still relatively slow, GIFs proved to be an efficient solution for sharing animated content, offering a lightweight and easily accessible alternative to heavier formats.
</p>
<h3>The Spread of Viral GIFs:
</h3>
<p>The advent of the internet has led to an increasingly frequent spread of GIFs, many of which have gained viral notoriety. The "dancing baby" was one of the first GIFs to achieve this status, quickly spreading through forums and websites. This phenomenon is emblematic of the viral nature of GIFs, capable of capturing attention and spreading rapidly across the network.
</p>
<p>With the advent of social media and the growth of visual content sharing platforms, GIFs have become even more popular. They have become a universal visual language, used to express emotions, humor, and even social commentary quickly and effectively.
</p>
<h3>Artistic Renaissance of GIFs:
</h3>
<p>In recent years, GIFs have experienced a renaissance as a digital art form. Contemporary artists have embraced this format, harnessing its brevity and repetition to create unique and engaging works of art. Artistic GIFs have become a form of digital expression, blending visual aesthetics, concise messages, and dynamic movement.
</p>
<p>Our archive of artistic GIFs aims to preserve and celebrate this evolution, offering a wide range of works that testify to the versatility and originality of this fascinating format. From an online sharing tool to an artistic means of expression, the history of GIFs is intrinsically linked to the continuous transformation of the digital landscape.

    <h1>Gif Art</h1>
    <h3> Introduction to the figure of the GIF artist:</h3>
        <p>The GIF artist is an innovative and dynamic figure in the field of contemporary digital art. They harness the power of Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) to explore new expressive and communicative frontiers. While GIFs originated in online content sharing, the GIF artist has transformed this format into a unique medium. They challenge traditional artistic conventions and create works that stand out for their brevity, repetition, and visual impact.
        </p>
        <h3>Exploring creativity in loops:
        </h3>
        <p>The GIF artist excels in the ability to tell stories, explore complex emotions, or capture attention through sequences of cyclically repeating moving images. The peculiarity of this format lies in its "loop" nature. It offers artists the opportunity to play with temporality, transition, and visual rhythm. This cyclicality allows for the creation of engaging visual narratives and the expression of complex concepts within a limited space.
        </p>
        <h3>From animation to social reflection:
        </h3>
        <p>Many GIF artists go beyond visual aesthetics, addressing social, cultural, and political themes. They strategically use the medium to trigger immediate reflections and engage the audience in a visual conversation. The brevity of GIFs proves particularly effective in capturing attention in a digitally saturated world. It provides an art form that is both immediate and powerful in its emotional impact.
        <h3>A cultural connector:</h3>
    </p>
    <p>GIF artists often serve as cultural connectors, creating works that resonate with contemporary experience and the dynamics of digital culture. Through the use of iconic visual elements, references to popular culture, or symbolic references, these artists become part of the fabric of online conversation. They contribute to defining and redefining the visual culture of the internet.

    <h1>About</h1>
    <p> Welcome to part two of this brief journey through the rich history of one of the newest and most popular art forms, the animated GIF. To read the first part, “The Early Years: 1997–2008,” click here.
 
 GROUP BLOGS, SURF CLUBS, AND THE BEGINNING OF SOCIAL NETWORKING
 The period from 2006 to 2010 was marked by the rise of self-started social networks. Artists were sharing GIFs on Myspace before many migrated to their own collaboratively run blogs. These sites hosted an enormous number of found and self-made GIFs, and tended to be male-dominated. A few highlights from the golden era of GIF art blogs below. Digital Media Tree, 2000–present
 This consortium of four blogs built on custom software by Jim Bassett includes Bill Schwartz, Sally McKay and Lorna Mills, Tom Moody, and Pst. Only two of the artists focused on New Media and GIFs, the duo of McKay and Mills, and Moody—and he has since moved his blog to WordPress. All that said, Digital Media Tree was a much needed New Media presence in the early blogging scene with archives dating back to 2003, when the blog was mostly image-less.
 
 According to Mills, it was McKay’s interest in animated GIFs that originally influenced her and Moody, both of whom went on to work extensively with the format. McKay’s own GIF production has slowed, but there are vast archives to click through on her page, Mills’, and Moody’s, as well as a paper that McKay wrote in 2009, which closely examines the animated GIF called, “The Affect of Animated GIFs (Tom Moody, Petra Cortright, Lorna Mills).” The essay is required reading for anyone interested in the medium.
 
 Computers Club, 2007–present
 Computers Club founder Krist Wood describes it as a “digital sculpture,” a composite artwork shaped by the identities of its contributors. All members have been invited by Wood, and new members are rarely added. Basically, it’s a collaborative art blog with a green rotating splash page and no visible publishing dates. According to the members page, Computers Club has 19 members.
 
 Unsurprisingly, the blog has hosted seemingly countless GIFs over the seven years it’s been running. Recent images tend to be supersized, but they already tended to be large back when the site launched. Artists usually post their own work.
 
 The Computers Club Drawing Society works differently. Artists are encouraged to apply for membership and invitations are periodically given out. There is a communal set of digital drawing tools members can use to make images, and they are shared on a public page. Most posts draw one or two comments from artists, typically expressing appreciation for the work.
 
 Computers Club Members: Sage Keeler, Petra Cortright, Alexandria McCrosky, Daniel Williams, Matthew Wrath, Laura Brothers, Robert Lorayn, Krist Wood, Rene Abythe, Nicolas Sassoon, Sara Ludy, Duncan Malashock, Travess Smalley, Rafael Rozendaal, Alexander Peverett, Kathleen Daniel, Sabrina Ratte, Elna Frederick, Angelo Plessas, and Wyne Veen.
